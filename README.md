# IT-Project-FraUAS
This project contains Python scripts for dynamically generating exercises on DFS and BFS. Each script generates random adjacency matrices, while two scripts can also create visual graphs using Graphviz. The goal is to produce a large number of diverse exercises for students to solve in the area of algorithms and data structures. 
The exercieses are formatted into an XML-file which can be inserted into the plattform Jack3 which was created by the University Duisburg-Essen. 

This project was part of the module IT-Project which was done in collaboration with students at the HOGENT University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

Note: the scripts depend on specific helper classes, which cannot be included in this repository. One helper funcion is coded by myself which is included within the scripts. 



# Usage
- To use these scripts, you need to insert a valid folder pathway which contains a XML-file generated by Jack3. 
- After running the code, the XML-file will be updated. A folder with the graphs is also automatically created.
- The file (and graphs) can simply be uploaded in Jack3.
